Application of Augmented Reality Technology on Basic Electrical Circuits
In this thesis, Augmented Reality technology, which has attracted considerable attention in the 
field of information technologies in recent years, has been applied on basic electrical circuits and an 
augmented reality application called ARKTUNApp has been developed. While this technology is known 
to be applied in a wide range from military applications to medical simulations, its applications in the 
field of education are also becoming widespread. In this context, students studying in technical branches, 
engineering and technology faculties in vocational high schools or universities are targeted. A booklet
containing basic circuits (short circuit, open circuit, circuit with series-connected resistors, circuit with 
parallel-connected resistors, RLC circuit, diode and LED circuit, environmental currents method and node 
voltage method) has been created especially within the scope of vocational courses such as 
Electrotechnics, Electronics and Circuit Analysis, which engineering students see. There are two different 
QR codes on this booklet: The first one directs to a link where the application can be downloaded, and the 
second one is the QR codes located next to the two-dimensional circuits. After the first QR code is 
scanned with the smart device and the application is downloaded and opened, when the QR codes located 
next to the two-dimensional circuits on this booklet are scanned, the aforementioned circuits can be 
viewed in three dimensions and concretely observed. The developed application is a diagnostic-based 
augmented reality application. Unity3D platform and Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK were used to 
implement the application. Unity3D allows applications developed to run on various operating systems 
such as Android, Windows and iOS. Three different programming languages such as UnityScript 
(Javascript), C# and Boo can be used within the scope of Unity3D. The application carried out within the 
scope of the thesis was developed with C# programming language for smart devices with Android
operating system (minimum 7.0 version). 3DS Max was used in the arrangement of circuit components 
and circuits. There is a menu in the application and the user can switch to the desired circuit. As a result, 
it is ensured that some terms and concepts that can remain abstract in theoretical expression are conveyed 
to the student in a more concrete way. The results of the AR application developed within the scope of 
this thesis were analyzed by the survey method that is an instrument of assessment.
